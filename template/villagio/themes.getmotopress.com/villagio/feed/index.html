		<description><![CDATA[Our villa in Lazio is a great place to discover and enjoy the water life - beachfront, mountains and lots of fresh air. However, if you also want to some some magnificent places of gardens, you'll love the garden tour near our Lazio's villa. 

A rewarding half-day trip from Bolsena, this labyrinth of immaculately clipped box hedges has resisted the vagaries of garden fashion to come down to us unchanged from the early 17th century. Sounds quite attractive for you, isn't it? ]]></description>

<p>Hidden in the 12 parterres are the initials of the garden&#8217;s founder, Ottavia Orsini, and her sons. The current owner is simpatica Princess Claudia Ruspoli, personally guides visitors around the garden which she has restored and put into her work a lot of passion. Tours, which also take in her castle home, Castello Ruspoli, take place on Sundays from April to the end of October.</p>
<p>Groups can visit by appointment at other times too.</p>

<p>Another castle you can visit it Castello di Rivalta &#8211; The castle and the medieval village belong to the Zanardy Landi family, a branch of the Landi familily that owns the castle since the 13 th century.The castle is open for guided tours &#8211; you can visit the honour room , dining room, copper kitchen , wine cellar, prisons, bedrooms,tower realized by Pietro Antonio Solari.</p>
<p>One more beautiful castle is Rocchetta Mattei &#8211; a very interesting and mysterious castle. This castle was built in 10th century by Dr. Mattei, a very strange doctor: he was interested and expert in alternative medicine as well in occultism so the castle is full of symbols related to different religions and to Freemasonry.</p>
<p>All of these castles are close to you if you stay in our villa and book a tour with us.</p>

People are searching for meanings, let&#8217;s find yours. So, what about a villa in Lazio?</p>
<p>Lazio, which gets its name from “Latium,” has sandy beaches along the coast and hills and small mountains further inland. It’s home to famous lakes, like Bracciano and Albano; the lovely Castelli Romani hills; medieval towns and Renaissance gardens. So, if you are searching for some places of historical interest in one bunch with a great sea and mountains resort, Lazio is the best for you.</p>
<p>But what about Campania? If you’re looking for a taste of sun-soaked south, but don’t have time for more than a day or weekend trip from Rome or Florence. Or, you want this stay in villa just to be the next step in your trip.</p>
<p><span id="more-98"></span></p>
<p>If you’re in love with Naples and you want to visit Italy’s most famous coastline ; you won’t necessarily have your own car; you want to taste real mozzarella di bufala and proper pizza napolitana! All these things will lead you definitely to Campania.</p>
<p>So, think one more time and check rooms availability of each villa to see when it&#8217;s available. And be prepared to have your best stay!</p>
