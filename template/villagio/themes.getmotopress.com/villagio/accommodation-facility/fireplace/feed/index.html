				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cottage Monte Bianco in Aosta Valley is a well-decorated, warm and fully functional country cottage perfect for your winter vacation.</p>
<p>This mountain cottage is made up of stone and timber built on two storeys, with a large living room, glass window, a couch for two people and a bathroom with sauna.</p>
<p>The second storeys features a double bedroom. There is also a queen bed. There is a large garden with mountain view outdoors. You may also use a porch equipped with BBQ and a wooden table.</p>
<p>The site is located on the pleasant hills between Aosta Valley mountains. We have currently added two beds, set up in a wonderful Indian teepe available for two extra guests in addition to the four ones. Four beds for children are still the same.</p>
